# Functions, nested loops
		

		
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.
		

		
## Technologies
		
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
		
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
		

		
## Files
		
All of the following files are programs written in C:
		

		
| Filename | Description |
		
| -------- | ----------- |
		
| `0-Putchar.c` | Prints `Putchar` |
		
| `1-alphabet.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase |
		
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase |
		
| `3-islower.c` | Checks for lowercase character |
		
| `4-isalpha.c` | Checks for alphabetic character |
		
| `5-sign.c` | Prints the sign of a number |
